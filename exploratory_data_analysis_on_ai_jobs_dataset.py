"""### Insights
* High demand for AI/ML roles—top 5 are all AI-related.

* Shift toward specialized roles (e.g., AI Architect, Autonomous Systems Engineer).

* Research-focused roles like ML Researcher are leading—R&D is a priority.  

* Engineering roles dominate over analyst roles—industry is moving beyond basic analytics.  

* Suggest internal upskilling programs to meet AI talent needs.

"""### Insights from Salary vs Education vs Experience
* Salary increases with experience across all education levels
More years of experience lead to higher salaries, regardless of degree type.

* **PhD* holders consistently earn the highest salaries
At nearly every experience level, **PhD** graduates top the salary chart.

* **Bachelor’s** and **Associate degrees** offer similar salary growth up to mid-level experience
These two education levels show comparable salary trends until around 8–12 years of experience.

* **Master’s** degree offers balanced growth higher than **Bachelor’s**, lower than **PhD**
Provides a strong salary trajectory without requiring a PhD.

* Education has a strong impact early in a career; experience dominates later initial salary differences are shaped by degree, but over time, experience becomes the bigger driver.

* **Germany** has the highest number of hybrid and on-site jobs, suggesting a preference for mixed or traditional work environments.

* **China** and **Canada** show higher remote job counts, indicating strong remote-friendly policies.

* **Finland** and **United Kingdom** show relatively low remote job presence, implying limited remote opportunities.

* **India** and **Ireland** show a balanced distribution across all three types, signaling flexible work models.

* Remote jobs are fairly spread, but fewer in **Japan**, **UK**, and **Switzerland**, pointing to more office-based work cultures there.

* *USD* is the dominant salary currency globally.  
* *EUR* is used in select European countries Countries like **Germany**, **France**, and the **Netherlands** report salaries in EUR, as expected for Eurozone nations.  
* *GBP* is used exclusively in the *UK* .The **United Kingdom** is the only country using *GBP*, reflecting its distinct currency system.  
* The heavy use of *USD* across diverse locations may indicate a trend toward standardized reporting, aiding easier salary comparisons.  
* Despite each country’s standard currency, the frequent use of *USD* reflects international hiring and salary normalization in global tech roles.
